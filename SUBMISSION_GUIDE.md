### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/new

   - Name: `primetrade-task-management`
   - Description: "Scalable Task Management Web App with JWT Authentication - Frontend Developer Internship Assignment"
   - Visibility: Public
   - ✅ Add README (Already have one)
   - Don't initialize with .gitignore (Already exists)

3. **Copy the repository URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/primetrade-task-management.git`)

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd /Users/anujsmacbookair/PrimeTrade

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Complete task management system with authentication - Frontend Developer Internship Assignment"

# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/primetrade-task-management.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Update Personal Information

Before submitting, update these files with your actual information:

1. **README.md** - Add your name and GitHub profile
2. **PROJECT_SUBMISSION.md** - Add your name, email, GitHub username
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Add your contact info

### Step 5: Create a Professional README on GitHub

Make sure your GitHub repository README includes:
- ✅ Project title and description
- ✅ Features list
- ✅ Tech stack
- ✅ Setup instructions
- ✅ Screenshots (optional but impressive)
- ✅ Live demo link (if deployed)

### Step 6: Optional - Deploy Live Demo

Deploy your application for extra points:

**Frontend (Vercel):**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel
```

**Backend (Railway/Render):**
- Sign up on Railway.app or Render.com
- Connect GitHub repository
- Add environment variables
- Deploy
